Jevelyn and Chris

Description: This should be an overview of your area of responsibility. What is it? What is it's purpose? How does it support the goal of the project?
Chris and Jevelyn are responsibile for the planning stage. To help plan and keep the project organized. we have decided it would be best for us to use Trello to help keep all the students, tasks, and tools organized, this will help the goal of our project, considering communication has been kind of hard. 

Upstream Dependencies: Identify any components or resources that are required in order for you to install/setup the technologies in your area of responsibility. For example, DNS records should be created with appropriate IP information before installing certain software or services.
we would need to purchase Trello to have access, the package I thought was best cost $10 a month. It includes the following:
Views: Calendar, Timeline, Table, Dashboard, and Map
Workspace views: Table and Calendar
Unlimited Workspace command runs
Atlassian Intelligence (AI)
Admin and security features
Workspace-level templates
Collections
Observers
Simple data export
Unlimited boards
Advanced checklists
Custom Fields
Unlimited storage (250MB/file)
1,000 Workspace command runs per month
Single board guests
Saved searches

Downstream Dependencies: Identify any other hardware, software, or services that depend on your area of responsibility being functional.
with Trello, nothing else would be need to plan
